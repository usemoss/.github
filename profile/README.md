# 👋 Welcome to Moss

We build real-time semantic search infrastructure for conversational and agentic AI.

---

### Why Moss

AI interfaces are changing.
Voice agents, copilots, and multimodal apps all share the same hard requirement:

**retrieval must happen at the speed of thought.**

But today’s search stacks are:
- too slow for real-time interaction
- overly cloud-dependent
- painful to integrate and scale

Moss exists to fix that.

### What We’re Building

Moss is a **real-time search runtime** designed for AI-native applications:

- ⚡ **Sub-10ms semantic + hybrid retrieval**
- 🌍 **Runs anywhere** — browser, edge, on-device, or cloud
- 🧠 **Built for agents** — memory, personalization, context
- 🧩 **Simple APIs** that feel like using a database
- 🚀 **Developer-first**: easy to start, hard to outgrow

Think of Moss as the search layer modern AI apps should have had from day one.

---

### What It’s Used For

Teams use Moss to power:

- Voice AI agents that can’t afford latency
- Conversational copilots with long-term memory
- Multimodal systems blending text, voice, and context
- Real-time personalization for AI-driven products

If retrieval is on your critical path, Moss is built for you.

### Where We’re Going

We’re building the foundation for **real-time AI-native applications** —
infrastructure that matches how users actually interact with AI.

We’re early, but already working closely with teams pushing this space forward.

If you’re building fast, interactive AI systems — welcome.
